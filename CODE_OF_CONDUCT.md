- Remove/edit comments, commits, PRs, issues, etc. if they cross the line

## 🌐 Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to:  
- All community spaces (repo, issues, PRs, chats, etc.)

## 📊 Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will use these levels of impact when deciding consequences:  

### 1. 🟢 Correction  
**Impact**: Small slip-up or language that wasn’t cool.  
**Consequence**: Private message explaining what went wrong, why it’s not okay, and how to do better. Public apology may be requested.  

### 2. 🟡 Warning  
**Impact**: Clear violation (one-off or repeated).  
**Consequence**: Formal warning with conditions. No interaction with affected parties or enforcers for a set time. Breaking this = ban.  

### 3. 🔴 Temporary Ban  
**Impact**: Serious violation or repeated bad behavior.  
**Consequence**: Temporary block from all community interaction. Breaking this = permanent ban.  

### 4. 🚫 Permanent Ban
