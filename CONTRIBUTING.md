### 🥞 How to contribute?

<details>
<summary>1️⃣ Fork this repo (basically, copy-paste but fancier)</summary>

So yeah… click the big fork button.  
Think of it as cloning yourself but with less moral consequences.

<details>
<summary>2️⃣ Name your fork</summary>

Go wild. Call it `my-epic-fork`, `project-but-better`, or `pls-work-this-time`.  
Naming is free therapy.

<summary>3️⃣-4️⃣ Open it, then make a branch (yes, another one, don’t touch <code>main</code>)</summary>

- Never mess with `main` unless you like explosions 💥.  
- Branch = your personal sandbox. Do whatever. Break stuff.  
- Name it something descriptive like `fix-bug`, `add-feature`, or `make-it-pretty`.
